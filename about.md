# Mission

Provide answers to the most common questions about homelessness: “What can I do to help the homeless in Los Angeles?”

Advocate for the homeless through public education projects. Regularly drive attention and interest in the problem through thought a variety of means (text article, data visualizations, infographics). Influence public policy through public education. Collect and analyze data on homeless populations and service providers. Try to determine who is most in need, which interventions are most effective, and pain points in the process.


# History

This project is an outgrowth of [Hack for LA](http://hackforla.org/), an organization that regularly organizes Civic Hacking Days & Nights to address issues for the city of Los Angeles. We meet weekly at the [La Kretz Innovation Center](http://laincubator.org/la-kretz-innovation-campus/) in downtown Los Angeles, easy walking distance to [Skid Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skid_Row,_Los_Angeles) - one of largest populations of homeless people in the United States.

As a group we've noticed a dramatic increase in the number of people living on the streets in our respective neighborhoods, and we're all here to do our part to help our neighbors find longterm housing.
